# Project 3 – Evaluation → Introspection → Behavior Update Agent  
_Reflection-Driven Self-Improvement for AI Agents_

This project implements a **closed-loop self-improvement system** for AI agents, where the agent:

1. Evaluates its own performance
2. Diagnoses *why* it succeeded or failed
3. Converts insights into **explicit behavior rules**
4. Applies those rules in future runs
5. Demonstrates **measurable improvement over time**

This moves agents beyond static reasoning into **adaptive, learning-oriented systems** without retraining.

## Why This Project Exists

Most agents today can:
- reason
- plan
- execute

But they **do not get better**.

They may critique outputs, but:
- critiques don’t change future behavior
- failures repeat across runs
- learning remains implicit and brittle

This project treats **introspection as a control signal**, not commentary.
